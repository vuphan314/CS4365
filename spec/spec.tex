\subsection{Lexicon}

These lexemes are \textdef{keywords}:
\begin{codeblock}
unknown constant function let return check \\
if else true false or and not
\end{codeblock}

A \textdef{number} is either:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{i}, or
\item one or more consecutive digits
(\code{0} to \code{9})
\end{itemize}

An \textdef{identifier} is one letter
(\code{a} to \code{z} or \code{A} to \code{Z})
followed by zero or more letters and digits.
Also, an identifier must not be a keyword.

Note: blank characters (spaces, tabs, newlines)
are delimiters.
